It is recommended that you install LightSaml with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Best way would be to just let the composer choose the appropriate version

```bash
$ composer.phar require lightsaml/lightsaml
```

After that you will have LightSaml installed in your vendor directory.

If you don't prefer composer, you can download source code directly from
[LightSAML github repository](https://github.com/lightSAML/lightSAML).
