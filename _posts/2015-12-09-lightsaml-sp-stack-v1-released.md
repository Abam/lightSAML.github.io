The LightSAML Service Provider stack has been tagged with 1.0.0. This release includes core
[lightsaml/lightsaml](https://github.com/lightSAML/lightSAML/releases/tag/1.0.0) library, the
[lightsaml/symfony-bridge](https://github.com/lightSAML/SymfonyBridgeBundle/releases/tag/1.0.0), and
the security listener [lightsaml/sp-bundle](https://github.com/lightSAML/SpBundle/releases/tag/1.0.0).

On the predecessor version libraries, [aerialship/saml-sp-bundle](https://github.com/aerialship/SamlSPBundle) and
[aerialship/lightsaml](https://github.com/aerialship/lightsaml), a note has been put about the new LightSAML version
being in it's own organization.

We're excited awaiting broader audience and heavier real time usage, and expecting some feedback from the community.


What's next
-----------

SP stack being released, beside it's improvements and maintenance, next on the roadmap are
